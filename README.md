## Guidelines for Contributing to MicroQA
1. Create a test job from the MicroQA Jenkins instance (or edit an existing job)
  * Click the _New Job_ link.
  * Enter a descriptive job name and use the _Copy existing job_ option to pick a job that is similar to what you want to do (or a new empty job is there are no similar jobs).
  * After the job is created, then _Configure_ the job to do what you want it to do.
  * Add a description to the job by clicking _edit description_ on the job page. The description should be very clear about what the job does. Make sure that your job's use case is general enough to be useful to other people.

2. Test your job and ensure it's working like you want.

3. From your micro-qa directory login to the instance using the command: "vagrant ssh"

4. Run the command "jenkins-sync" inside the vagrant instance.

5. Exit the vagrant shell then commit your changes to the MicroQA repo.

6. Once your commit is available on GitHub submit a pull request to the upstream repository.

Make sure that each pull request you submit contains a single new job, or fixes to a single job. Try not to combine too many changes in a single pull request.
